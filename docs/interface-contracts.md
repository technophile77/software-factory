# Interface contracts

Approved interfaces between the factory's components, and between agents.
Nothing here changes without an approved decision in the **Interfaces**
category. Each change updates this file, the implementation, the tests, and
every dependent component together.

**Status:** no contracts approved yet. The first ones will come from open
decisions 2 and 3 (how agents report results, and the shape of an inbox item).

## Contract entry format

```
### <Name> — v<major>.<minor>
- Status: Proposed | Approved | Deprecated
- Owner decision: <link>
- Used by: <components>
- Definition: <schema, signature, or format>
- Compatibility: <what changes are breaking>
```
