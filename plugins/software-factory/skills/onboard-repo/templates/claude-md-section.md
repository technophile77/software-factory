## Software factory

This repository is managed by the software factory
(<FACTORY_REPO_URL>, version `<FACTORY_VERSION>`), as part of the
`<PROJECT_NAME>` project (config repo: <CONFIG_REPO_URL>).

The factory's rules apply here as written in that version:

- No code for a feature until its spec has passed the readiness gate.
- The owner decides requirements, architecture, interfaces, assumptions and
  security; agents prepare options and a recommendation, then ask.
- Change-controlled files need an approved Configuration hygiene item for
  every edit: this section, `.claude/`, `.github/`, and the project
  manifest (including its role policy) in the config repo.
- Security criteria: the factory's `docs/security-standards.md`.
  Testing bars: `docs/testing-strategy.md`. Gate bars: `docs/maturity-levels.md`.
- This repo's maturity level is recorded in the project manifest,
  `factory-project.yaml` in the config repo above.
